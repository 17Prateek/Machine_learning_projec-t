# Machine_learning_projec-t
in this repo have many types of machine learning projects

# Movies Recommendation System
 In this project we have  trained a model which deduct the similar  kind of movies and
 recommend  users . we have used text classification , feature extraction and
 vectorization based on nearest neighbors algorithm.
 
# Restaurant Review feedback System
 In this project we have trained the model to auto deduct the positive and negative
 reviews . we have used the tools like text classification ,  feature extraction and
 vectorization based on NLP.
 
# Attendance System
 In this project we have trained a model that will deduct the face by CV2 library and 
the model trained by logisticRegression alogorithm.
